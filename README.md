# Password-Generator

## Description

This my first time using javascript to create a random password generator. My objective was to get prompts to appear on screen for user's to choose a password length between 8-128 and select either numbers, symbols, lowercase and uppercase letters. Once the user selected their choices, a random password based off their criteria selected would appear in a text box. This was a challenging process of figuring out how I can use conditional statements to compensate for all options a user may decide. On the other hand, it presented me with a new learning of how I can use conditional statements in a effective way when creating things for other users.
